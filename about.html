          &nbsp;&nbsp;A Better Camera Store was founded in 2024 when the
          founder, Jasper Robinson took a dream and made it a reality. He became
          interested in photography in 2022 when he bought an old film camera
          online. He fell in love with the art of photography and the magical
          experience of film photography. That camera sparked an interest and
          Jasper learned everything he could about the art.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;He eventually applied to work at a local camera store in
          the hope that he could learn as much as possible and have fun doing
          it. He learned to really love the experience of helping customers with
          their photography needs and new he wanted to continue. He had plenty
          of ideas to improve the store he worked at, but the owners didn't have
          a passion for it enough to make a change. He decided to open his own
          camera store where the focus was on the customers and their needs and
          the services could be completed efficiently with that in mind.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;He found that St. George didn't have a camera store and
          saw a need that he could fill. He and his wife, Bella decided to take
          a chance and chase this dream. A Better Camera Store Company was born
          and Jasper's Camera opened in 2024!
